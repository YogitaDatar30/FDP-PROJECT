### **Key Student Feedback**

Based on the responses, here are the key takeaways from student feedback:

* **Positive Feedback:** Students overwhelmingly found Euclid's algorithm to be an efficient and simple method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD). They appreciated learning about how it breaks down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.  
* **Questions and Confusions:**  
  * **Application:** Several students asked for more real-world examples, especially concerning its use in computer science, programming, and cryptography.  
  * **Reverse Problem:** One student asked a thought-provoking question about the "reverse problem"â€”finding the two original numbers given only their GCD.  
  * **Procedural Errors:** One student mentioned making mistakes in substitution and calculations when in a hurry, leading to an incorrect GCD.

### **AI-Generated Insights**

The feedback highlights a clear pattern: while the core concept of the algorithm is well-understood, students are eager to connect it to practical, real-world applications. The questions about cryptography and computer science indicate a desire for more contextual learning beyond the abstract mathematical process. This suggests that the current teaching approach is effective for the "what" and "how" but could be strengthened by adding more "why." The difficulty with substitution also points to a need for more practice or a breakdown of common errors.

### **One Change You'll Make in Your Next Class**

To address the key feedback and insights, in the next class, I will dedicate a specific segment to exploring the practical applications of Euclid's algorithm. I'll provide:

* **Real-World Examples:** A brief, yet engaging, discussion on how the algorithm is foundational to public-key cryptography (like the RSA algorithm) and is used in computer graphics for tasks like simplifying fractions to prevent display errors.  
* **A "Reverse Problem" Challenge:** I'll pose the "reverse problem" to the class and explain why it's not uniquely solvable, which will deepen their understanding of the algorithm's properties.  
* **Guided Practice:** I'll walk through a more complex example, explicitly highlighting common pitfalls like incorrect substitution and offering a step-by-step method to double-check their work.
