For me the topic from my own learning journey: **Learning Google Apps Script Automation in Google Sheets** 

Here’s the **story in four parts** based on **Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle**:

---

## **1\. Concrete Experience (What happened?)**

During the IIT Ropar FDP Cohort 6, I was introduced to Google Apps Script as a powerful tool to automate tasks within Google Sheets. We worked on a project where we created scripts to automate formatting, calculate totals and averages, and apply conditional formatting to data sets of student scores. This hands-on experience required me to write and debug scripts that ran seamlessly without using manual formulas.

## **2\. Reflective Observation (What did you notice?)**

I noticed how automation could dramatically reduce manual errors and save time, especially with repetitive data tasks. Initially, I struggled with understanding the flow of data and correctly referencing ranges and columns in the script, especially when structural changes were made to the sheet. The FDP discussions helped clarify these concepts, and through peer collaboration, I realized the value of breaking problems down into smaller logical steps.

## **3\. Abstract Conceptualization (What did you learn?)**

I learned that understanding the data structure and scripting logic in Apps Script is vital for writing effective automation. The experience emphasized planning: calculating totals, then averages, followed by applying flags and conditional formatting in a consistent sequence. I understood that automation is not just about efficiency but also about maintaining accuracy and ensuring repeatability in workflows.

## **4\. Active Experimentation (What will you do next?)**

Moving forward, I plan to expand my use of Google Apps Script to automate other administrative and academic tasks such as generating reports, sending automated emails, and integrating Google Workspace apps. I also want to develop scripts from scratch rather than relying solely on templates, improving my coding skills. I intend to share this knowledge within my professional and learning communities, possibly conducting workshops like the one at IIT Ropar FDP.
