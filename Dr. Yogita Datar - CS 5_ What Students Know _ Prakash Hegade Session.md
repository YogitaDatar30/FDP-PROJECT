 **Semester:** III (BCA)

**Part 1: Threshold Concept of Probability: Randomness**

**What Students Know**

·        Randomness means unpredictability or chance.

·        Examples: tossing a coin or rolling a die.

·        They are aware that outcomes can vary but expect some kind of pattern or fairness.

**What Students Don’t Know**

·        Randomness is not chaos but governed by probabilistic rules.

·        Patterns emerge over many trials despite individual unpredictability.

·        Misconceptions such as gambler’s fallacy (expecting outcomes to "even out" quickly).

·        The formal mathematical modeling of randomness (probability distributions).

·        How randomness applies in technical fields like computing, networks, and algorithms.

**Principles**

·        Randomness is intrinsic unpredictability in event occurrence within a known set of outcomes.

·        It is modeled probabilistically, allowing for statistical analysis.

·        Randomness causes variability but underlies predictable long-term patterns.

·        Understanding randomness is transformative in grasping probability, enabling higher-level learning.

**Part 2: Case Study – Teaching "Randomness" Using Bloom, Fink, and SOLO Taxonomies**

| Feature | Bloom’s Taxonomy | Fink’s Taxonomy of Significant Learning | SOLO Taxonomy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Nature** | Hierarchical cognitive skills from recall to creation with clear verbs. | Holistic and interactive; includes cognitive, affective, and metacognitive domains. | Structured levels of learning complexity from surface to deep understanding. |
| **Application in Case** | Focus on cognitive development: |  |  |

 

·        Remember: Define randomness.

·        Understand: Explain randomness in experiments.

·        Apply: Conduct coin toss experiment.

·        Analyze: Distinguish randomness from non-randomness.

·        Evaluate: Detect misconceptions (e.g., gambler’s fallacy). | Emphasizes connection and caring:

·        Foundational knowledge: grasp randomness.

·        Application: engage in experiment.

·        Integration: relate randomness to IT applications.

·        Human dimension: discuss feelings about unpredictability.

·        Learning how to learn: reflect on new understanding. | Evaluates understanding progress:

·        Pre-structural: no clear grasp of randomness.

·        Uni-structural: recognize randomness concept.

·        Multi-structural: know examples and rules separately.

·        Relational: integrate randomness with probability theory.

·        Extended abstract: generalize and predict using randomness in new scenarios.|  
 | **Assessment**  | Quizzes, problem-solving tasks, explanations. | Reflective journals, discussions, attitudinal surveys. | Tasks demonstrating increasing conceptual complexity and integration. |  
 | **Teaching Strategies** | Lectures, quizzes, experiments, Q\&A on misconceptions. | Experiential learning, reflection, group projects linking to real-world and tech. | Diagnostic assessments, scaffolded questions moving from definition to application.|

**Part 3: Reflection Questions Mapped to Learning Outcomes**

| Reflection Question | Mapped Learning Outcome |
| :---- | :---- |
| How would you describe randomness in your own words? | Express foundational conceptual knowledge on randomness in probability. |
| What previous misconceptions about randomness have you identified? | Recognize and correct common misconceptions in probability understanding. |
| How did the coin toss experiment affect your view of randomness? | Apply theoretical concepts in practical experimental contexts. |
| Why is understanding randomness important in technology/computing? | Connect theoretical probability concepts to real-world computer applications. |
| How confident are you in your current understanding of randomness? (Rate 1-5) | Self-assess cognitive and affective learning progress related to the topic. |
| What is one question you still have about randomness and probability? | Promote metacognitive reflection to identify further learning needs. |
